# GF Tomato Sauce

My friend Marissa made this for our group of friends while on vacation. I love the simplicity, whilst still packing punches of flavor. My first obvious comparison was [to the tried and true sauce recipe](https://archive.ph/pmsDK) I have been resenting since college. What the two methods have in common is the little scraps of crushed tomato that are immersed in flavorful gravy. In my opinion this recipe achieves this goal better with the staccato flavor of the cherry tomatoes, which blister in a way that renders them much more noticable than the canned, albeit hand-crushed, tomatoes of the [other recipe](https://archive.ph/pmsDK). This is just a good fucking sauce, OK???

This sauce does best in a pasta, or for serving with a meat like chicken parm or meatballs. It should not be used for pizza.

## Ingredients

You're going to want to roughly match the proportion of tomato puree to cherry tomatoes at a 2:1 ratio. There should be 1 clove of garlic for every 100g of tomato puree. The amount of pine nuts and parmesean are somewhat preferential. One can definitely go "too far" with pine nuts, whereas it is difficult to have "too much" parmesean. Due to the insane price of pine nuts one might want to skip them altogether. Good parmesean should have a degree of nuttiness anyways. If that is the case, go extra on the parmesean.

- garlic - 8 cloves
- fresh basil - 10g
- tomato puree (boxed, canned, etc) - 750g
- cherry tomatoes - 300g
- pine nuts - 50g
- grated parmesean cheese - 25g
- olive oil
- butter
- red pepper flakes
- salt
- fresh ground pepper

## Instructions

*Preparation*
- Wash the tomatoes.
- Wash the basil, and pluck the leaves from the stems.
- Prepare a large, open **skillet**.
- Prepare a small **pan** for pine nuts.
- Prepare a **slotted spatula**, the metal kind you might use on the grill.
- Measure out ingredients with a **scale** or other tool.
- Turn on the range/stove fan to prepare for oil/frying.

*Cooking*
1. Crush the garlic. Finely chop it.
2. Lightly coat the surface of the skillet with olive oil. Place on stove at medium heat.
3. Once sizzling becomes audible, throw garlic into the skillet. Circulate the olive oil around the garlic so as to give all the bits a light coating.
4. Continue to cook on medium before garlic starts to brown.
5. Pour cherry tomatoes into skillet. Circulate oil so as to give them a light coating. Turn heat up to high.
6. Add red chili pepper flakes, to taste. The heat they deliver will be rather dull, so don't be too shy with them.
7. Cook tomatoes until they start to blister.
8. Once the tomatoes are blistered and maybe a bit charred, add the entirety of the tomato puree to the pan. Stir thouroughly. Bring heat down to low.
9. Chop the basil coarsely. Add it to the skillet. Stir.
10. Add salt and ground pepper to taste, stirring as you go.
11. With the slotted spatula, softly crush the cherry tomatoes in the sauce.
12. Put the separate pan on the stove and place on medium heat. Place a small slice of butter in the center. Add the pine nuts, circulating them often so as to coat them in the melted butter. They should only be a couple minutes on medium heat. Do not let them turn too brown. Remove them from heat before they start to turn dark brown.
13. Let the skillet with tomato contents cook on low until uniformly bubbling across the surface.
14. Add all the parmesean cheese to the skillet. Stir thoroughly. It should melt right in.
15. Remove the sauce from heat. Add the pine nuts to the sauce. After stirring thoroughly, the sauce is ready to serve.

## Marissa's Original Instructions

> Sauté lots of chopped garlic (almost a whole head) in olive oil- sometimes I throw anchovies into the mix as well- once garlic is almost brown (but not brown) throw in the cherry tomatoes and cook them on high heat until they are start to blister open. Then I smash them down and had a can of fresh tomato purée. And of course lots of salt pepper red pepper basil and cheese!
