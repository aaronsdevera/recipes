## Marissa's Original Instructions

> Sauté lots of chopped garlic (almost a whole head) in olive oil- sometimes I throw anchovies into the mix as well- once garlic is almost brown (but not brow) throw in the cherry tomatoes and cook them on high heat until they are start to blister open. Then I smash them down and had a can of fresh tomato purée. And of course lots of salt pepper red pepper basil and cheese!
